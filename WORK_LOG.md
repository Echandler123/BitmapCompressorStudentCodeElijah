Then increment repeat amount each time it is the same |

| Dec 3   |  6:00 - 6:30  | Deleted most of my code for the compress and expand methods as I was getting index out of bounds with a for loop so switching to while loop and was adding the bits as ints when I can just use booleans as the data is all binary so the data can be represented by booleans. I have rewritten about half of the compress method. |
