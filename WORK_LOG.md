| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Nov 18  | 1:10- 1:40  |                                                 Thought about how to complete the problem set and started compress method |
| Nov 20  | 10:40-11:10 | Started for loop to go through bits and check if they are the same. Then increment repeat amount each time it is the same |
| Nov 20  | 11:10-11:40 |                            I added variables to check if the bit is one or zero and if a part had been compressed or not. |
