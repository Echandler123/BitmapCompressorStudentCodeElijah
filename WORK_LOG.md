| Nov 20  |  10:40-11:10  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Started for loop to go through bits and check if they are the same. Then increment repeat amount each time it is the same |
| Nov 20  |  11:10-11:40  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I added variables to check if the bit is one or zero and if a part had been compressed or not. |

I have rewritten about half of the compress method. |
| Dec 3   | 10:30 - 11:00 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Rewrote compress method and completed expand method but have not tested yet. |
| Dec 4   | 10:05 - 10:35 | I ran the code and the file differed so I went back and fixed my expand method. I had 2 while loops when I should've had an if statement instead of the second while. I was also using > 256 for the repeat count which is too big as it will stop at 257 not 255. I was also not subtracting 255 from the repeat length as that is how many were added to the file. I also an if statement excess bits. |
